*State-of-the-Art Blockchain Credentials: A tool for creating IDs on top of various blockchain protocols*

---
> Security is a multi-faceted concern to individuals, requiring solutions that can address multiple challenges. BlockchainMe offers counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof identification credenticals that hold the only information you choose, verifiable by only the people you chose to give it to. This is an application for creating a voluntary identification system that adapts quickly to population changes, new security threats, and the needs of increasingly diversified individuals. As layers of digital security grow more complex technologies that help prevent skimming, catfishing, counterfeiting and other fraudulent activity are critical. 

> Applying blockchain technologies in smart innovative ways is critical. The decentralized consensus algorithm implemented in the Bitcoin currency; accounts for every transaction on a public ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain records which address own which Bitcoins. Every time a transaction occurs in the economy everyone in the network is updated on it. Anyone who wants to check the existence of a transaction can look it up on the public blockchain. Every Bitcoin has it own digital signature, and is kept in its own digital address. All the digital address and their value content are visible from anyone with a copy of the blockchain. The core of this innovation is at its decentralized structure, and its use as a currency is only the begining of blockchain applications.

> ###### Using the blockchain for documents instead of money turns the public ledger into a register to fight fraud and forgery.

> ## Why chose blockchainMe for your IDs?
1. **[Flexible Identity Solutions](docs/identitySolutions.md)**
2. **Machine Readable Technologies:** All information embedded on your card is verifiable on the blockchain
  - Design and Printing: layout, artwork, and designs can be download and proposed by the users
  - Material and Card Construction: print a hard copy of your blockchain ID or order one for delivery
3. **Security Features**: Customize a layered and mix of content to achieve your desired level of security. All content is encrypted with a secure hash algorithm that serves two primary purposes. 
  1. To create a unique collision proof "hash" (the execution of the algorithm) value
  2. that can only be verified by encrypting the original data and comparing the two hash values.
