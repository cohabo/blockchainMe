*State-of-the-Art Blockchain Credentials: A tool for creating IDs on top varifyable on the blockchain*

---
Security is a multi-faceted concern to individuals, requiring solutions that can address multiple challenges. BlockchainMe offers counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof identification credenticals that hold the only information you choose, verifiable by only the people you chose to give it to. This is an application for creating a voluntary identification system that adapts quickly to population changes, new security threats, and the needs of increasingly diversified individuals. As layers of digital security grow more complex technologies that help prevent skimming, catfishing, counterfeiting and other fraudulent activity are critical. 

## Why chose blockchainMe for your IDs?
1. **[Flexible Identity Solutions](docs/identitySolutions.md)**
2. **Machine Readable Technologies:** All information embedded on your card is verifiable on the blockchain
  - Design and Printing: layout, artwork, and designs can be download and proposed by the users
  - Material and Card Construction: print a hard copy of your blockchain ID or order one for delivery
3. **Security Features**: Customize a layered and mix of content to achieve your desired level of security. All content is encrypted with a secure hash algorithm that serves two primary purposes. 
  1. To create a unique collision proof "hash" (the execution of the algorithm) value
  2. that can only be verified by encrypting the original data and comparing the two hash values.
